         <p>Today was a hard day.</p>
        <p> Today i had a lot of work, but the main thing that I had to do was to find a house in Almaty to live during the off-line coures. I've searched whole app, but did not find any normal advertsment. Mostly, my requests were rejected because i am a boy, people think that boys make home more dirty.
